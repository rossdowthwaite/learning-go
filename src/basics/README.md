# Go Basics

Code examples demonstrating basic concepts:

- Functions
- Arguments
- Variables

## Key Points

### Main

- The entry point to a program has to be a function called **main**, within a package called **main**
- There can be only on main function per package.

### Imports

- The `import` key word is used to declare packages used in the file
- Packages can be from Go's standard library, or third party
- Imported packages must be used, otherwise a comilation error occurs
